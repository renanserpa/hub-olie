# Atlas / Agents Documentation

This folder centralizes the OlieHub Atlas and Agents Pack reference: strategy playbooks, naming and interaction standards, and the conceptual layers for GOD, Catalyst, and Core Code Assistant roles. These documents guide human collaborators; they are not mutated by the application at runtime and should never be deleted.
